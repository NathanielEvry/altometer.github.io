<p>Greetings! I&rsquo;m Nathaniel Evry, a passionate technologist with a diverse set of skills and a love for innovation. With years of experience in the tech industry, I&rsquo;ve built and implemented software systems for a variety of clients and projects. Currently, I serve as the Chief Research Officer at quub, a small aerospace startup. In this role, I bring my knowledge of miniaturized electronics, signal transmission and reception, hardware design, coding, architecture, and research to the table.</p>
<p>In my free time, I love to tinker with hardware, experiment with new programming languages, and explore the great outdoors. Philosophy, science fiction, and art are some of my other interests that I try to incorporate into my work whenever possible.</p>
<p>I have a vast range of skills including 3D printing, systems architecture, software engineering, data science, PCB and electronic engineering, hardware prototyping, and much more. I&rsquo;ve worked with numerous technologies and enjoy staying up to date with the latest news, exploits, and toys.</p>
<p>Some fun facts about me: I was an early adopter of 3D printing and have printed, donated, and trained others on the assembly of 3D printed prosthetic hands for kids. I&rsquo;ve built and raced high-speed FPV drones, and I&rsquo;m a regular speaker and contributor to the Lancaster Open Source Community.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my blog. I&rsquo;m excited to share my ideas, experiences, and musings with you, and I look forward to engaging in meaningful conversations with fellow technology and innovation enthusiasts. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out, and let&rsquo;s connect!</p>
