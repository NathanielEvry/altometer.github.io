      <description>The Legend of Anthony
  Hey folks, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a crazy story to tell you today. Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve had this thing happen to me about a dozen times where I find a singular ant just hanging out on my arm or leg. It&amp;rsquo;s happened at home, at work, even in the middle of the city. Weird, right?
Anyway, someone recently called me an animal summoning Disney princess because of this, and it got me thinking&amp;hellip; what if this ant is my own personal superhero, like Batman or Ant-Man?</description>

      <description>New Blog, Who Dis?  Link to heading   It&amp;rsquo;s a question that we&amp;rsquo;ve all asked at some point in our lives - whether we&amp;rsquo;re starting a new job, moving to a new city, or embarking on a new adventure. And it&amp;rsquo;s a question that I&amp;rsquo;m asking myself today, as I sit down to write my first post for this brand new blog.
My name is Nathaniel Evry, and I&amp;rsquo;m a passionate technologist with a diverse set of skills and a love for innovation.</description>
